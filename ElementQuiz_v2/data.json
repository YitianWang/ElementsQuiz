Understanding your investment goals can help determine the types of investments best suited to meet your needs. One important factor to consider when selecting investments is the length of time you plan to have your money invested, your investment time horizon. Investors with a longer time horizon have a greater degree of flexibility when building a portfolio and may be able to take on more risk. If you have a very short time horizon, more conservative investments may be more suitable."
